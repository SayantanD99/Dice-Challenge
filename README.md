# Dice-Challenge Game

This is a simple and fun game that you can play with your friends or family. The game uses two dice, one for each player, and randomly rolls them to get a number from 1 to 6. The player with the higher number wins the game, and the webpage shows a message to congratulate them. If both players get the same number, the game is a draw and the webpage shows a message to indicate that.

The game uses JavaScript to generate random numbers and images for the dice. The images are stored in a folder called “images” and have names like “dice1.png”, “dice2.png”, etc. The JavaScript code selects an image based on the random number and changes the source attribute of the image elements on the webpage. The code also compares the numbers and changes the text content of the heading element on the webpage to show the result of the game.

You can play the game by refreshing the webpage or clicking a button that runs the JavaScript code again. Have fun and may the luck be with you!
